Internet Programming – Coursework (University of Western Macedonia)

This repository contains assignment solutions for the Programming on the Internet course.
The content is kept here primarily to demonstrate:

✔ my ability to organize repositories

✔ use Git/GitLab effectively

✔ structure and document small projects

✔ work with multiple languages in coursework

Important:
JavaScript is not my primary programming language.
These files represent academic exercises, not production-level JS work.
